This is a habit tracker project that uses react for front end with node js for backend as well as dummy data for the app on a db.json file.

Prelude:
Many people struggle to stay consistent with building their habits often leading to frustration and feeling disappointed when it comes to improving oneâ€™s self in terms of personal growth 
This is also due to the fact that there is lack of tools for tracking, motivation and holding one accountable for not keeping up to par with their improvement goals.

How we came up with the idea
Inspired by personal struggles with maintaining habits.
Observed a common need among peers for habit-building tools.
Passionate about helping others stay disciplined and achieve personal growth.

Features of the app
Habit Creation form for adding a new habit or activity.
Dashboard/table for displaying habit list.
A summary/feature showing habit status/progress.
A Description/reason for the habit.

Technologies used
Frontend: React.js (for an interactive user interface).
Backend: Node.js (for data handling).
Database: Dummy data from a db.json file 

Challenges
The possible challenges we could face while building the app are as follows:
Managing app state effectively for habits and reminders.
Designing a user-friendly interface for mobile and desktop.
Syncing habit data in real-time across devices.
Keeping users motivated through engaging features.
Visuals: Chart or list with icons for each challenge.

1."npm install" to install all the packages
2. "npm install -g json-server" for the backend
3. "npm start" to run the front end
